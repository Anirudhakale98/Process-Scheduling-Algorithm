### Description

Implemented various Operating System process scheduling algorithms including FCFS (First-Come, First-Served), SJF (Shortest Job First), Priority, RR (Round-Robin), and Multilevel Queue. This project serves as an excellent resource for learning and experimentation in OS development, providing insights into different scheduling strategies and their effects on system performance.

## Learning Outcomes

This project significantly enhanced my understanding of Operating System principles and process scheduling algorithms. I gained practical experience in implementing and analyzing the performance of fundamental scheduling algorithms, crucial for OS development and system optimization.
